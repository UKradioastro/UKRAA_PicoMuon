# Python code for the UKRAA PicoMuon
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](/LICENSE)


Set of Python code to run on a RPi4/5 to get, process and present data from the UKRAA PicoMuon detector

This software was written to suit a specific set-up, feel free to use as you see fit.


Instructions for setting up a Raspberry Pi4/5 are included in the **docs** folder

### Can I update to latest version?

There is a section on updating your software to the latest version at the bottom of this README.

&nbsp;

---

&nbsp;
<!-- =============================================================================== --> 
### Where is my detector?

Plug your detector into any of the RPi USB ports - I normally use the blue ports (USB3).

1. Open a terminal window and type the following command and press enter
```
ls /dev/tty*
```

![img_48](images/RPi_imager_48.PNG)

&nbsp;

2. You are looking for **/dev/ttyACM0** - this is on the right hand side of the screen shot above.

&nbsp;

3. This is the USB address for your attached detector - if you have more than one detector attached you may see **/dev/ttyACM1** etc.

&nbsp;

4. If you do not see **/dev/ttyACM0**, then unplug and plug the detector back in and try again.

&nbsp;

5. As long as you see **/dev/ttyACM0** then you do not have to make any changes to the python scripts, because they are looking for **ACM0**.

&nbsp;

---

&nbsp;
<!-- =============================================================================== --> 
## Using the code

The code assumes that your UKRAA PicoMuon detector is connected to the RPi4/5 via supplied USB cable and that it is /dev/ttyACM0 - you can check this by using **ls /dev/tty*** in a terminal window on the RPi4/5 and reviewing the response.

The code assumes username is **pi**.  If **pi** is not the username, then you will need to change all occurances of '/home/pi' to '/home/*username*' in the python and gnuplot scripts, where *username* is the username you have selected for your RPi4/5.

The code assumes one detector connected to the RPi4/5 USB and that it will be connected via **/dev/ttyACM0**, if there are other devices connected to the RPi and your detector is not **/dev/ttyACM0**, then you will need to change **/dev/ttyACM0** to **/dev/*ttyACMx*** in the **GetDataRawACM0.py** python script, where *ttyACMx* is the tty address of you connected detector.

**GetDataRawACM0.py** is run as a service.

Other scripts (Python, gnuplot and shell) are run from **cron**

&nbsp;
<!-- =============================================================================== --> 
## Getting the software onto your RPi

1. Log into your Raspberry Pi4/5 using VNC.

&nbsp;

2. Open a terminal window, type the following command and press enter
```
git clone https://github.com/UKradioastro/UKRAA_PicoMuon
```

![img_01](images/RPi_imager_01.PNG)

This will download all of the code to the directory **UKRAA_PicoMuon** inside **/home/pi**

---

&nbsp;
<!-- =============================================================================== --> 
## Installing the software onto your RPi


1. Open a terminal window and type the following command and press enter
```
cd ~/UKRAA_PicoMuon/install
```

![img_02](images/RPi_imager_02.PNG)

This will take you to the **install** directory inside **/home/pi/UKRAA_PicoMuon**


2. Type the following command and press enter
```
chmod +x *.sh
```

![img_03](images/RPi_imager_03.PNG)

This will make the **install.sh** script executable.


3. Type the following command and press enter
```
sudo bash install.sh
```

![img_04](images/RPi_imager_04.PNG)

This will run the install script.

There will be occasions during the running of the install script that require you to make a keyboard entry.

When asked **Do you want to continue? [Y/n]** - type **Y** or **y** and press **enter** 

During **mysql_secure_installation** you will be asked a number of questions.  

* Enter current password for root (enter for none): ------> press **enter**
* Switch to unix_socket authentication [Y/n] -------------> type **n** and press **enter**
* Change the root password? [Y/n] -----------------------> type **n** and press **enter**
* Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] -----------------------> type **y** and press **enter**
* Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] ---------------------> type **y** and press **enter**
* Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] ----------> type **y** and press **enter**
* Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n] ----------------------> type **y** and press **enter**

That's it!

The code is now set up to run automatically; it will get the data from the detector, process yesterdays data, plot yesterdays data and post yesterdays plots to your intranet web page once per day, at 9.30am in the morning.

<!-- =============================================================================== --> 
## What does the code do?

The code receives the event data from the UKRAA PicoMuon detector via serial over the supplied USB cable and stores the event data to the raw data folder:

The raw data will be processed overnight, via CRON, to get counts per minute, the frequency of the counts per minute and the frequency of the adc values for your previous day's data.

A number of plots will be created:
* counts per minute
* frequency of counts per minute
* frequency of ADC values recorded

The raw data will also be processed overnight, via CRON, to produce % deviation of muon counts, this data is supplemented by a request  to [NMDB](https://www.nmdb.eu/) via NEST to get the previous days recorded neutron count, which will be overlaid onto the day / week / month / etc % deviation counts graphs.

These will appear as the required amount of data is recorded by the detector

A simple web server and web page is set up on your RPi so that you can view your detector's results on your desktop PC and/or smart phone when connected to your home network.

To access the webpage on your desktop PC or your smart phone…

1.	Open your preferred web application (Safari, Chrome, Firefox, etc.).

2.	In the search bar type the following and press enter
```
http://rpi4-UKRAA.local
```

This will take you to the web page for your detector, displaying yesterday’s events graphs.

NOTE: if you have a different **hostname** for your RPi, change the search bar entry to…

**http://_hostname_.local**

Where *hostname* is the hostname for your RPi setup.
