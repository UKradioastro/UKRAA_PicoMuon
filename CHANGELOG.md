## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Phase 0 runtime foundations: validated version/date helpers, owner-aware service and installer setup, managed cron scheduling, and separate timestamped error logging.
- Dynamic installation-root lookup for the legacy processing and plot scripts.

### Changed
- Daily processing now runs as a single locked pipeline at 01:15 local time; until Phase 2 replaces the legacy processing implementation, runtimes can remain long.
- Updated the installation instructions for non-`pi` users.
